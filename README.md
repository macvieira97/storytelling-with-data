# storytelling-with-data
In this repository I am sharing my studies of storytelling with data, based on the book by Cole Nussbaumer: Storytelling with data: Let's Practice!.
Storytelling with data is filled with teachings, tips and behind the scenes rationales of how to get the hold on methodically and creatively analysing your data and communicating what is truly important to your audience. It encourages you to be concise, creative and straight to the point, no clutters nor pie charts. 

This repository will then be where I'll share my practices along my studies. I am using Plotly for the moment, but will possibly try out new tools to analyse data and generate visuals. PowerBI is right ahead in my list.  

# Visuals

In the first exercise of the book we are asked to make a given table look better in different ways. These are the ways I've made them. I found out that Plotly enables the use of basic html language, which was a nice surprise and my first contact with the language!

## The table
